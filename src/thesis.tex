\agraiments{
    I would like to extend my gratitude to the many people who have accompanied me throughout my academic and personal journey.
    This list is not exhaustive, but it seeks to acknowledge how fortunate I have been to receive support from so many along the way.

    First and foremost, I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional love, support, and encouragement,
    and for all the gentle nudges away from local optima.
    Your perspective will always be invaluable.

    I am also grateful to my friends from the Cinema Club (Adrià, Nacho, and many others),
    who to this day remind me that being a nerd is actually kind of cool.

    Thanks to teacher Israel, who recognized my love for mathematics early on and always encouraged me to pursue it.

    To my university classmates Miguel, Carlos, Nazar, Gerard, Nacho, and Severino:
    thank you for the endless laughs, the fruitful discussions, the shared struggles,
    and maybe one too many late-night study sessions.
    It really is about the friends we make along the way.

    I would like to thank Doctor Rubén Ballester and Professors Carles Casacuberta and Sergio Escalera
    for guiding my first steps into the world of mathematical research
    and encouraging me to pursue a master's degree in mathematics.

    Thanks as well to Professor Oriol Serra and Doctors Guillem Perarnau, Juanjo Rué, and Patrick Morris
    for introducing me to the fascinating world of discrete mathematics.

    Finally, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Doctor Richard Lang,
    for his guidance, support, and patience throughout this thesis.
    I truly felt that you cared not only about the project, but also about my personal and academic growth.
    Thank you for the opportunity to work with you and learn from your expertise.

    Turán-type problems are a central theme in extremal (hyper)graph theory.
    Given a fixed $k$-graph $G$,
    they ask for the maximum number $\ex{n}{G}$ of edges a $k$-graph on $n$ vertices can have
    without containing $G$ as a subgraph.
    This thesis deals with degenerate Turán-type problems, in which $\ex{n}{G} = o(n^k)$.
    In particular, we focus on $t$-blowups of an edge,
    denoted $\compoverset{k}{t}$.

    Classical existence theorems by Kővari, Sós, and Turán (for $k=2$) and Erdős (for $k \ge 2$)
    guarantee that $k$-graphs with constant edge density contain $\compoverset{k}{t}$ as a subgraph, where $t$
    grows with the number of vertices $n$ (typically $t$ is on the order of $(\log n)^{1/(k-1)}$).
    These proofs are non-constructive,
    and locating such large subgraphs efficiently
    is challenging as brute-force search becomes superpolynomial in $n$.

    This thesis presents a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm that bridges this gap in the constant density regime.
    Given a $k$-graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, our algorithm finds a $\compoverset{k}{t}$ where $t$
    explicitly depends on $n$, $k$, and the density $d=m/n^k$, matching the best possible order of magnitude.
    Our method generalizes work on the bipartite $2$-graph case by Mubayi and Turán, using a recursive strategy on link graphs.
