\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Hypergraph Turán problems study how many edges a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices can have without containing a specific subgraph $G$.
The maximal such number is known as the \emph{Turán number} $\ex{n}{G}$.
It is known~\cite{keevash2011hypergraph}
that $\ex{n}{G} = o\left( \binom{n}{k}\right)$ if and only if $G$ is $k$-partite, i.e.,
if its vertex set can be partitioned into $k$ disjoint sets such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each part.
Kővári, Sós, and Turán~\cite{Kovari1954} (for $k=2$) and
Erdős~\cite{Erods1964} (for any $k \geq 2$) established that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64-intro}
    \ex{n}{\compoverset{k}{t}} = \bigO{n^{k - \frac{1}{t^{(k-1)}}}},
\end{equation}
where $\compoverset{k}{t}$ is the complete balanced $k$-partite $k$-graph with $k$ parts of size $t$.
Furthermore, if $H$ is a $k$-graph with at least $d \binom{n}{k}$ edges for some constant $d > 0$, then it contains a $\compoverset{k}{t}$ with
$t = c_d \log(n)^{1/(k-1)}$.

This result is non-constructive, meaning it guarantees the existence of such a subgraph but does not provide an efficient way to find it.
Note that a simple brute-force search for a $\compoverset{k}{t}$ would involve checking all $\binom{n}{kt}$ vertex subsets, which is superpolynomial in $n$ for $t = \Theta((\log n)^{1/(k-1)})$.
Mubayi and Turán~\cite{MUBAYI2010174} developed a polynomial-time algorithm for the case $k=2$, which reaches the stated order of magnitude for the subgraph part size.
This paper extends their approach to the general case of $k$-uniform hypergraphs, reaching analogous results for $k \ge 3$.
More concretely, we prove the following.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:main_theorem}
There is a deterministic algorithm that, given a $k$-graph $H$ with $n$ vertices and $m=dn^k$ edges, finds a complete balanced $k$-partite subgraph $\compoverset{k}{t}$ in polynomial time, where
\[
    t = t(n, d, k) = \dots % TODO: write the formula for t
\]
\end{theorem}
This value of $t$ matches the order of magnitude from existence proofs.
In fact, a probabilistic argument shows that it is the best possible up to a constant factor.

\section{The algorithm}\label{sec:finding-a-balanced-$k$-partite-subgraph}

We present a recursive algorithm, \texttt{FindPartite}, that finds a $\compoverset{k}{t}$ in a given $k$-graph $H$.
The core idea is to reduce the uniformity of the problem from $k$ to $k-1$ in each recursive step.
The algorithm takes a $k$-graph $H$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges as input.
It first defines the target part size $t$, a small set size $w$,
and a threshold edge count $s$ for the recursive call, based on the input graph's parameters:

\begin{align*}
    t(n, d, k) &= \dots, \\
    w(n, d, k) &= \dots, \text{ and } \\
    s(n, d, k) &= \dots,
\end{align*}
where $d = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{k}}$ is the edge density of $H$.
The main steps are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Base Case ($k=1$):} The edge set of a 1-graph is just a collection of vertices.
    Return the set of all vertices that are ``edges''.

    \item \textbf{Select High-Degree Vertices:} Choose a set $W \subset V$ of $w$ vertices with the highest degrees in $H$.

    \item \textbf{Find a Dense Link Graph:} Iterate through all $t$-subsets $T \subset W$.
    For each $T$, consider the set $S$ of all $(k-1)$-subsets of $V$ that form a hyperedge with \emph{every} vertex in $T$.

    \item \textbf{Recurse:} As we prove further along using the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem, for at least one choice of $T$,
    the resulting set $S$ will be large ($|S| \ge s$). We form a new $(k-1)$-graph $H'=(V, S)$ and make a recursive call: \texttt{FindPartite($H'$, $k-1$)}.

    \item \textbf{Construct Solution:} The recursive call returns $k-1$ parts $V_1, \dots, V_{k-1}$ of size at least $t$.
    By construction, every choice of vertices from these parts forms an edge in $H'$ with every vertex of $T$.
    Thus, $(T_1, \dots, T_{k-1}, T)$ form the desired $\compoverset{k}{t}$ in the original graph $H$.

\end{enumerate}

The pseudocode is given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:kpartite}.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

We now presnt the proof of correctness and polynomial runtime for our algorithm.
We assume $t \ge 2$ for our estimates to be easier.
If $t < 2$, we may just return the vertices of any single edge in $H$.

\subsection{Correctness}\label{subsec:correctness}

The correctness of the algorithm hinges on these key lemmas.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion-and-future-work}

We have presented a deterministic,
polynomial-time algorithm to find a large complete balanced $k$-partite subgraph in any sufficiently dense $k$-uniform hypergraph.
This provides a constructive counterpart to a classical existence result by Erdős in extremal hypergraph theory.

Several avenues for future research remain open.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General Blow-ups:} Our algorithm finds a blow-up of a single edge, $\compoverset{k}{t}$.
    Can this framework be adapted to find a $t_n$-blowup of an arbitrary fixed $k$-graph $G$? Existence theorems guarantee such structures, but efficient algorithms are lacking.
    \item \textbf{Unbalanced Partite Graphs:} The algorithm could be modified to search for unbalanced complete partite graphs $\compdots{t_1}{t_k}$, where the part sizes may grow at different rates.
    \item \textbf{Optimality:} The bounds on $t$ are asymptotically tight, but the constants can likely be improved with a more refined analysis.
    For $k=2$, it is known that in dense graphs one can find a $t=\Theta(\log n)$ blow-up of any bipartite graph.
    It is an open question if a constructive proof for this stronger result exists for $k \ge 2$.
