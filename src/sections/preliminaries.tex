\section{Basic Definitions and Results}\label{sec:preliminaries}
In this section we introduce some basic definitions and results that are used throughout this thesis.
We start with some preliminaries on hypergraphs, which are the main objects of study in this thesis.

\subsection{Hypergraphs}\label{subsec:hypergraphs}

\begin{definition}

    For an integer $k \geq 1$ a finite \emph{$k$-uniform hypergraph} (or \emph{$k$-graph}, for short)
    is a tuple $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set
    and $E \subset \binom{V}{k}$.
    We call the elements of $V(G) = V$ its \emph{vertices}
    and those of $E(G) = E$ its \emph{edges}.
    The value $k$ is called the \emph{uniformity} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    In the definition above, if we let $k=1$ we just get a set of $1$-sets of the vertex set $V$,
    which we can identify with a subset of $V$.
    If we let $k=2$ we recover the usual definition of an undirected graph with no loops.
\end{remark}

The following definition is a generalization of the notion of degree
of a vertex in a graph.

\begin{definition}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph and $v \in V$.
    The \emph{degree} $d_G(v)$ of $v$ in $G$
    is the number of edges containing $v$, that is
    \[
        d_G(v) = |\{e \in E \mid v \in e\}|.
    \]
\end{definition}

A useful operation on $k$-graphs is restriction to a subset of vertices,
which given a vertex subset of a graph gives a graph on that subset of vertices
with the same uniformity as the original graph.

\begin{definition}

    \label{def:restriction}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph and $T \subset V$.
    The \emph{restriction} of $G$ to $T$ is the $k$-graph
    \[
        G[T] = (T, E_T),
    \]
    where
    \[E_T = \{e \in E \mid e \subset T\}.\]
\end{definition}

The following operation also lets us obtain graphs of a
different uniformity from a subset of vertices of a $k$-graph.

\begin{definition} \label{def:link}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph.
    Let $1 \leq j \leq k - 1$ be an integer and let
    $T \subset V$ be a set of vertices satisfying $k - j \leq |T|$.
    The \emph{common $j$-link graph} of $T$ is the $j$-graph $\link{G}{T}{j} = (V \setminus T, E')$, where
    \[
        E' = \left\{Y \in \binom{V}{j}\middle\vert \, X \cup Y \in E \text{ for all } X \in \binom{T}{k-j}\right\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{figures/common_link}
    \caption{A $3$-graph $G$ and the common $2$-link graph $\link{G}{T}{2}$ of the set $T = \{A, B, C\}$.
        the link graph has vertex set $\{X, Y, Z, W\}$ and edge set
        $\{\{X, Y\}, \{W, Z\}\}$.
    }
    \label{fig:link}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:link} exemplifies how to construct
a common $j$-link graph from a $k$-graph $G$ in the case $k=3$ and $j=2$.
Vertices are represented as black dots, and $3$-edges of $G$ are represented as colored or gray small dots,
connected by a line to the vertices they contain.
Colored dots correspond to $3$-edges with exactly
$k - j = 3 - 2 = 1$ vertices in $T$, which are the only ones that can contribute to the common $2$-link graph.
Edges in the common $2$-link graph are represented as solid lines connecting the corresponding vertices,
in the same color that the $3$-edges they come from.
Dashed lines correspond to edge pairs
in $V \setminus T$ that have some of the required $3$-edges in $G$, but not all of them.

\begin{remark}
    Definition~\ref{def:link} might apppear confusing because $E'$ is defined
    as a set of subsets of $V$, while the link graph has vertex set $V \setminus T$.
    In fact, it is impossible for an element $Y \in E'$ to contain a vertex $v \in T$.
    To see this, suppose that $v \in Y$.
    We can pick a $(k-j)$-set $X \in \binom{T}{k-j}$ such that $v \in X$.
    Then $v \in X \cup Y$ and
    $| X \cup Y | < j + (k-j) = k$, contradicting the fact that $X \cup Y$ is an edge in $G$.
\end{remark}

Next, we introduce $k$-graph homomorphisms, embeddings and isomorphisms, which allow us
to relate $k$-graphs of the same uniformity to each other.

\begin{definition} \label{def:embedding}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ and $H = (W, F)$ be $k$-graphs and let $f: V \to W$ be a map
    between their vertex sets.
    If $A \subset E$ is a set of edges in $G$, we denote
    \[
        f(A) = \{f(e) \mid e \in A\} = \{\{f(v) \mid v \in e\} \mid e \in A\}.
    \]
    Then, $f$ is a \emph{homomorphism} from $G$ to $H$ if
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:homomorphism}
        f(E) \subset E(H[f(V)]).
    \end{equation}
    If such a homomorphism exists
    and is injective, we say that $f$ is an \emph{embedding} of $G$ on $H$
    and that $H$ \emph{contains} $G$ as a subgraph.
    We write $G \subset H$.
    If, furthermore,
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:induced_embedding}
        f(E) = E(H[f(V)]),
    \end{equation}
    we say that $f$is an \emph{induced} embedding
    and that $H$ contains $G$ as an \emph{induced} subgraph.
    We write $G \subset_{\text{ind}} H$.
    If, in addition, $f$ is a bijection, we say that $f$ is an \emph{isomorphism}
    and that $G$ is \emph{isomorphic} to $H$.
    We write $G \cong H$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Condition~\eqref{eq:homomorphism} of definition~\ref{def:embedding}
    implies that $f$ is injective
    when restricted to vertices in $E$, because $G$ and $H$ have the same uniformity.
    However, it does not necessairily imply that $f$ is injective on all of $V$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    In Definition~\ref{def:embedding}, given that a map $f: V \to W$ is an embedding,
    a different way to state that it is an induced embedding is to say that
    $f^{-1}: H[f(V)] \to G$ is also an embedding.
\end{remark}

For the notions that we have introduced to be useful,
we need to show some basic properties.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:embedding_properties}
    Graph inclusion $(\subset)$ and induced graph inclusion $\left(\subset_{\text{ind}}\right)$
    are preorder relations on $k$-graphs.
    \begin{proof}
        We need to show that the relations are reflexive and transitive.
        Reflexivity is clear, as the identity map is an induced embedding of a $k$-graph in itself.
        Let $G, H,$ and $K$ be $k$-graphs with vertex sets $X, Y,$ and $Z$ respectively.
        If $G \subset H$ via $f: X \to Y$ and $H \subset K$ via $g: Y \to Z$,
        then $g \circ f: X \to Z$ is injective and satisfies that for each edge $e \in E(G)$,
        \[
            g \circ f(e) =
            \{g(f(x))\mid x \in e\} =
            \{g(y) \mid y \in f(e)\} \in E(K),
        \]
        because $f(e) \in E(H)$.
        Therefore, $G \subset K$ via $g \circ f$.
        If the embeddings are induced,
        and $e$ is an edge in
        $E(K[g \circ f(X)])$,
        then $e$ is also an edge in $E(K[g (Y)]) = g(E(H))$.
        Therefore, $e' = g^{-1}(e)$ is an edge in $H$.
        Furthermore, because $e = g(e') \subset g \circ f(X)$,
        we have that $e' \in E(H[f(X)]) = f(E(G))$,
        so $e \in g(f(E(G)))$.
    \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:isomorphism_equivalence}
    The relation of isomorphism $(\cong)$ is an equivalence relation on $k$-graphs.
    \begin{proof}
        The relation is reflexive via the identity map.
        If $f: G \to H$ is an isomorphism, then $f^{-1}: H \to G$ is also an isomorphism,
        so the relation is symmetric.
        Finally, if $f: G \to H$ and $g: H \to K$ are isomorphisms,
        then $g \circ f: G \to K$ is also an isomorphism, because it is bijective,
        and by Proposition~\ref{prop:embedding_properties},
        it is an embedding
        and $(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$ is also an embedding.
    \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Compatibility of Isomorphism and Embeddings]
\label{prop:isomorphism_preserves_embedding}
Let $G, G', H, H'$ be $k$-graphs such that $G \cong G'$ and $H \cong H'$.
Then,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G \subseteq H$ if and only if $G' \subseteq H'$.
    \item $G \subseteq_{\text{ind}} H$ if and only if $G' \subseteq_{\text{ind}} H'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Propositions~\ref{prop:isomorphism_equivalence},~\ref{prop:embedding_properties},
and~\ref{prop:isomorphism_preserves_embedding}
establish that the properties of containing a $k$-graph $G$ as a (induced)
subgraph within a $k$-graph $H$ depend only on the isomorphism classes of $G$ and $H$.
Therefore, discussions of (induced) subgraph containment can be conducted up to isomorphism.


\subsection{Turán Problem for k-graphs}\label{subsec:turan}

Now we can state the \emph{forbidden subgraph problem} for $k$-graphs.
Informally, given a $k$-graph $G$, and an integer $n \geq |V(G)|$,
we want to find the smallest $M_0$ such that all $k$-graphs with $n$ vertices and $m > M_0$ edges
contain $G$ as a subgraph.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:extremal}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph with nonempty edge set and $n \geq |V|$ be an integer.
    Then there exists an integer $M_0 = \ex{n}{G} \in \left[ 0, \binom{n}{k}\right)$ such that
    the condition
    \[
        \text{``All $k$-graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges contain $G$ as a subgraph''}
    \]
    is true for all $\binom{n}{k} \geq m > M_0$ and false for all $0 \leq m \leq M_0$.

    \begin{proof}
        Note that, if $M_0$ exists, clearly it is unique.
        Also, the condition is clearly false for $m = 0$ and
        true for $m = \binom{n}{k}$
        (the only graph $H$ with vertex set $W$, $|W|=n$ and $\binom{n}{k}$ edges
        is the one having all $k$-sets of vertices so any injective map $f: V \to W$
        is an embedding of $G$ in $H$).
        We only need to show that if the condition is true for $m$ then it is true for
        all $m' \geq m$.
        Suppose it is true for $m$ and let $m' \geq m$.
        Let $H = (W, F)$ be a $k$-graph with $n$ vertices and $m'$ edges.
        We can just take $F' \subset F$ with $|F'| = m$.
        By hypothesis, the graph $H' = (W, F')$ contains $G$ as a subgraph,
        and the identity map in $W$ is an embedding of $H'$ in $H$:
        \[
            G \subset H' \subset H \implies G \subset H. \qedhere
        \]
    \end{proof}

\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    The integer $\ex{n}{G}$ defined in Proposition~\ref{prop:extremal}
    is called the \emph{extremal number} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The extremal number is clearly invariant under isomorphism of $G$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Partite k-graphs}\label{subsec:partite}

\begin{definition}
    for an integer $p \geq k$, a $k$-graph $G = (V, E)$ is \emph{$p$-partite}
    if there exists a partition $V = V_1 \cup \dots \cup V_p$
    such that every edge $e \in E$ intersects every part $V_i$ in at most one vertex.
    We may write $G = (V_1, \dots, V_p; E)$ and say that
    $G$ is a partite $k$-graph on $V_1, \dots, V_p$.
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}\label{rem:ordered}
    If $p=k$, every edge intersects every part in exactly one vertex,
    so we can identify the edges with a subset of $ V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$.
    If it is clear from context, we may slightly abuse notation when talking about ordered and
    unordered sets of vertices, as in the definition below.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition} \label{def:complete_kpartite}
    A $k$-partite $k$-graph $G = (V_1, \dots, V_k; E)$ is \emph{complete}
    if $E = V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$.
    That is, if all $(v_1, \dots, v_k) \in V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$
    satisfy $\{v_1, \dots, v_k\} \in E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $V_1, \dots, V_k, W_1, \dots, W_k$ are disjoint sets
    and $|V_i| = |W_i| = a_i$ for all $i$,
    \[
        \compdots{V_1}{V_k} \cong \compdots{W_1}{W_k}
    \]
    where the isomorphism is given by any bijection
    \[
        f: V_1 \times \dots \times V_k \to W_1 \times \dots \times W_k
    \]
    such that $f(V_i) = W_i$ for all $i$.
    This allows us to talk, up to isomorphism, about \emph{the} complete $k$-partite $k$-graph
    with part sizes $a_1, \dots, a_k$, which we denote by
    \[
        \compdots{a_1}{a_k}.
    \]

\end{remark}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{figures/222}
    \caption{The complete 3-partite 3-graph $K(2, 2, 2)$, with parts $V_1, V_2, V_3$.
    Each vertex is represented as a black dot while
    each edge is represented as one of the colored dots, and connected by a line to the vertices it contains.}
    \label{fig:222}
\end{figure}

We can define completeness of $k$-partite $k$-graphs recursively: Let $G = (V_1, \dots, V_k; E)$
be a $k$-partite $k$-graph.
If $k=1$, $G$ is complete if and only if $E = V_1$ (as in Definition~\ref{def:complete_kpartite}).
Otherwise, $G$ is complete if and only if $\link{G}{V_k}{k-1}$ (which is a $(k-1)$-partite $(k-1)$-graph
on $V_1, \dots, V_{k-1}$) is complete.

\subsection{Degenerate Turán Problems}\label{subsec:degenerate}

\begin{remark}
    All $k$-partite $k$-graphs with part sizes $b_1 \leq a_1, \dots, b_k \leq a_k$
    are contained in $\compdots{a_1}{a_k}$ as subgraphs.
    This lets us follow the same argument as in Proposition~\ref{prop:extremal}
    to define the following.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:zarankiewicz}
    Let $0 < t_1 \leq v_1, \dots, 0 < t_k \leq v_k$ be integers.
    Then the \emph{generalized Zarankiewicz number} $z(v_1, \dots, v_k; t_1, \dots, t_k)$
    is the largest integer $0 \leq z < \prod_i{ v_i}$ for which there exists a $k$-partite $k$-graph
    $H$ with part sizes $ |V_1| = v_1, \dots, |V_k| = v_k$ and $z$ edges
    such that no embedding $f$ of $\compdots{T_1}{T_k}$ with $|T_i| = t_i$ in it exists
    satisfying $f(T_i) \subset V_i$ for all $i$.
\end{definition}

From now on, every time we talk about embeddings from one $k$-partite $k$-graph
onto another we assume the condition $f(T_i) \subset V_i$.

\begin{remark}\label{rem:zar_vs_turan}
    Finding this number can help us upper bound the extremal number of $\compdots{t_1}{t_k}$ asymptotically:
    Assume that $H$ is a $\compdots{t_1}{t_k}$-free $n$-vertex $k$-graph with $m$ edges.
    pick $v_1, \dots, v_k$ such that $\sum_{i} v_i = n $ and $v_i \sim n/k $
    (For example $\lfloor n/k \rfloor \leq v_i \leq \lceil n/k \rceil$)
    Let $V_1, \dots, V_k$ be a random partition of $V(H)$ with $|V_i| = v_i$.
    for an edge $e \in E(H)$, the probability that $e$ is an edge in $\compdots{V_1}{V_k}$ is
    greater than
    \[k! \prod_i \frac{v_i}{n} \sim \frac{k!}{k^k},\]
    which is independent of $n$.
    Therefore, the expected number of edges satisfying this condition is a positive fraction of $m$.
    Applying the first moment method, we can conclude that
    \[
        \ex{n}{\compdots{t_1}{t_k}} = \bigO{\zaroversetdots{k}{\lceil n / k \rceil}{t_1}{t_k}}.
    \]

\end{remark}


The problem on finding the Zarankiewicz number was first posed by K. Zarankiewicz in 1951 for the
case of bipartite 2-graphs (that is, finding $z(u, w; s, t)$),
in terms of finding all-1 sub-matrices in a $0-1$ matrix.
An upper bound for it in the case $u=w, s=t$ was found by Kővari, Sós and Turán in~\cite{Kovari1954} in 1954.
This was generalized to arbitrary complete
bipartite 2-graphs by C. Hyltén-Cavallius in~\cite{Hylten1958}
in 1958.
The result is stated and proved here for completeness.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:kst}
    Let $0 < s \leq u$ and $0 < t \leq w$ be integers.
    Then 
    \[z(u, w; s, t) \leq (s - 1)^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)u^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)u\]
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that we have a bipartite graph $G = (U, W; E)$
        with $|U| = u$, $|W| = w$ and $|E| = z$ exceeding the bound stated above.
        Let us consider the set
        \[
            P = \left\{ (x, Y) \in U \times \binom{W}{t}
            \middle\vert\, x \in N_G(Y) \right\}.
        \]
        Counting on the first coordinate, we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_p_lower}
            |P| =
            \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sum}}_{x \in U} \binom{d_G(x)}{t} =
            \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sum}}_{x \in U} \varphi(d_G(x)) \geq
            u  \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sum}}_{x \in U} \varphi(z/u) =
            u \binom{z / u}{t},
        \end{equation}
        where we define
        \[
            \varphi(x) =
            \begin{cases}
                \binom{x}{t}, & \text{if } x \geq t - 1. \\
                0, & \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \]
        The function $\varphi$ is convex, so we get the inequality in~\eqref{eq:kst_p_lower}
        as a consequence of Jensen's inequality.
        The other equalities come from the fact that $\varphi(d)$ agrees
        with $\binom{d}{t}$ for all integers $d \geq 0$;
        and that by our bound on $z$, $z \geq (t-1)u \implies z/u \geq t - 1$.

        If we had $s$ different elements of $P$ with the same second coordinate $T$,
        they would all necessarily have different first coordinates
        (say $S = \{x_1, \dots, x_s\}$).
        But now, by definition of $P$, for all $a \in S, b \in T$, we have $\{a, b\} \in E$.
        This would mean that the inclusion map from $ S \cup T$ to $U \cup W$ is an embedding of
        $K(s, t)$ in $G$, as described in Definition~\ref{def:zarankiewicz}.
        Supposing that this is not the case, by the averaging we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_p_upper}
            |P| \leq (s - 1) \binom{w}{t}.
        \end{equation}
        Putting inequalities~\eqref{eq:kst_p_lower} and~\eqref{eq:kst_p_upper}
        together, we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_chained}
            u \binom{z / u}{t} \leq (s - 1) \binom{w}{t}.
        \end{equation}
        Now, because we can see $E$ as a subset of $U \times W$,
        we get $z \leq uw \implies z/u \leq w$.
        In particular, we have
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_binom}
            \frac{(z/u - (t - 1))^t}{\binom{z/u}{t}} \leq \frac{(w - (t - 1))^t}{\binom{w}{t}},
        \end{equation}
        which is true for each factor when expanding the denominators.
        Multiplying inequalities~\eqref{eq:kst_chained} and~\eqref{eq:kst_binom} yields
        \[
            u \, (z/u - (t - 1))^t \leq (s - 1)(w - (t - 1))^t.
        \]
        Algebraic manipulation then gives
        \[
            z \leq (s - 1)^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)u^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)u,
        \]
        In contradiction with our assumption. \qedhere


    \end{proof}

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    Following Remark~\ref{rem:zar_vs_turan}, we can use this bound to get an upper bound on the extremal number of $K(s, t)$:
    \[
        \ex{n}{K(s, t)} =
        \bigO{(s - 1)^{1 / t}\left(\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil - t + 1\right)n^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil} =
        \bigO{n^{2 - 1 / t}}.
    \]
    Note that if $s < t$, we get the better bound $\bigO{n^{2 - 1 / s}}$ by interchanging the roles of $s$ and $t$.
\end{remark}

In 1964, Erdős~\cite{Erods1964} generalized this result to arbitrary complete partite $k$-graphs in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:erdos64}
    For $k \geq 2$ and $2 \leq t \leq \frac{n}{k}$,
    $\ex{n}{\compoverset{k}{t}} = \bigO{n^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}}$.
    \begin{proof}
        By Remark~\ref{rem:zar_vs_turan}, it suffices to show that
        \[
            z = \zaroverset{k}{w}{t} = \bigO{w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}}
        \]
        as $w \to \infty$.
        We prove this by induction on $k$.
        For $k=2$, this is obtained by setting $u = w$ and $s = t$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:kst}.
        For $k > 2$, suppose by way of contradiction that the theorem is false.
        For all ${w_0 \in \N}$, ${K \in \mathbb{R}^+}$, there exists a $k$-partite $k$-graph $G = (W_1, \dots, W_k; E)$ with part sizes
        $|W_i| = w \geq w_0$ and ${|E| \geq K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}}$ such that no embedding of $\compoverset{k}{t}$ in it exists.
        Consider, for each set $T \in \binom{W_k}{t}$, the associated \text{$(k-1)$-link}
        \link{G}{T}{k-1}.
        By our assumption, it can not contain $\compoverset{k-1}{t}$ as a subgraph.
        This means that
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:conditionlink}
            \link{G}{T}{k-1} \text{ has at most $z'$ edges for all } T \in \binom{W_k}{t},
        \end{equation}
        where
        \[
            z' = \zaroverset{k-1}{w}{t}.
        \]
        Now, consider the bipartite graph $G' = (U, W; E')$, where
        \begin{align*}
            U &= W_1 \times \dots \times W_{k-1}, \\
            W &= W_k, \\
            E' &= \{(X, y) \in V \times W \mid X \cup \{y\} \in E\}.
        \end{align*}
        Condition~\eqref{eq:conditionlink} is equivalent to saying that
        there is no embedding of $K(z' + 1, t)$ onto $G'$ respecting the respective partitions.
        Furthermore, $G'$ has the same number of edges as $G$.
        Finally, we invoke Theorem~\ref{thm:kst} with
        ${u = |U| = w^{k-1}}$ and
        ${s = z' + 1}$ to get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64_induction}
            K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} \leq
            |E| = |E'| \leq
            (z')^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)w^{(k-1)(1 - 1 / t)} + (t - 1)w^{k-1}.
        \end{equation}
        By the inductive hypothesis, for $w_0$ and $K'$ large enough, we can bound
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64prime}
            z' \leq K' w^{(k - 1) - \frac{1}{t^{k-2}}}.
        \end{equation}
        Substituting inequality~\eqref{eq:erdos64prime} into~\eqref{eq:erdos64_induction} and approximating yields
        \[
            K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} \leq (K')^{1 / t} w^{k-\frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} + (t - 1)w^{k-1}.
        \]
        Combining like terms and picking $K > 2 (K')^{1 / t}$ gives
        \[
            \frac{1}{2}K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} < (t - 1)w^{k-1},
        \]
        which we can rewrite as
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64_contradiction}
            \frac{1}{2}Kw^{1 - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} < (t - 1).
        \end{equation}
        This is a contradiction, because the right side of inequality~\eqref{eq:erdos64_contradiction}
        is constant in $w$, while the left side grows to infinity as $w$ increases.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

This approach can be generalized to give a lower bound on the number of
copies of $\compdots{t_1}{t_k}$ in a $k$-partite $k$-graph $G$
with different part sizes~\cite{carvajal2024canonical},
therefore upper bounding all generalized Zarankiewicz numbers.
