This thesis has focused on the algorithmic aspects of finding $k$-partite subgraphs in $k$-uniform hypergraphs, a problem central to degenerate Turán theory.
We have presented a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:kpartite}) that, given a $k$-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges, finds a complete balanced $k$-partite $k$-subgraph $\compoverset{k}{t}$. The part size $t$ achieved, given by Equation~\eqref{eq:t} as $t \approx (\log n / \log(1/d))^{1/(k-1)}$ where $d=m/n^k$, closely matches the parameters implicit in the non-constructive existence proofs of Erd\H{o}s for such structures. This provides an efficient, constructive counterpart to these classical results, demonstrating that these fundamental subgraphs can indeed be located algorithmically within polynomial time. The recursive approach, which reduces the uniformity $k$ by analyzing appropriately defined link graphs, generalizes previous work for the $k=2$ case by Mubayi and Turán.

There are several avenues for future research stemming from this work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Tightening Bounds and Improving Practicality:}
    The proofs of correctness for Algorithm~\ref{alg:kpartite}, particularly Lemmas~\ref{lm:sound} through~\ref{lm:t_prime}, involve several inequalities. While sufficient to establish the polynomial runtime and the asymptotic nature of $t$, some of these bounds are quite loose (e.g., approximations of binomial coefficients, conditions for $w \leq n/2$, or the constants in the density arguments). A more meticulous analysis could potentially yield sharper constants in the definition of $t(n,d,k)$ or relax the minimum density requirements (Remark~\ref{rm:min_d}). This could make the algorithm applicable to sparser hypergraphs or guarantee larger $k$-partite structures for a given density, enhancing its practical significance for analyzing real-world hypergraphs which might not meet the currently proven, somewhat high, minimum vertex or density thresholds.

    \item \textbf{Finding Blow-ups of General $k$-Graphs:}
    The presented algorithm is tailored to find blow-ups of a single edge, i.e., $\compoverset{k}{t}$. A natural extension would be to adapt this algorithmic framework to find $t_n$-blowups $H(t_n)$ of an arbitrary fixed $k$-graph $H$. As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:degenerate} (Theorem~\ref{thm:quant-blowup}), $k$-graphs with density $\pi(G) + \epsilon$ are known to contain $G(t_n)$ where $t_n = \delta (\log n)^{1/(|V(G)|-1)}$. Our current algorithm, if applied iteratively or adapted, might yield a constructive proof for finding such blow-ups.
    However, for $k=2$, it is known from Bollobás and Erd\H{o}s~\cite{bollobas1973structure} that the optimal growth for $t_n$ is $\delta \log n$, which is better than the $(\log n)^{1/(|V(G)|-1)}$ if $|V(G)| > 2$. The general question for $k > 2$ of whether $t_n = \delta (\log n)^{1/(k-1)}$ (or perhaps even better, related to $|E(G)|$) can be achieved for blow-ups of general $k$-graphs $G$ (not just an edge) via an efficient algorithm remains open. Investigating new algorithmic techniques, possibly deviating from the direct link-graph recursion if it proves suboptimal for general blow-ups, could be a fruitful direction.

    \item \textbf{Average-Case Analysis and Randomized Algorithms:}
    The current algorithm is deterministic. Exploring randomized versions might lead to simpler algorithms or improved part sizes $t$ on average, or with high probability. Furthermore, analyzing the performance of this algorithm on random hypergraph models (e.g., $G_{n,p}^{(k)}$) could provide insights into its typical behavior.

    \item \textbf{Implementation and Experimental Evaluation:}
    Implementing Algorithm~\ref{alg:kpartite} and evaluating its performance on various synthetic and real-world hypergraph datasets would be valuable. This could help identify practical bottlenecks and compare its findings with theoretical guarantees, especially concerning the constants involved in the calculation of $t$.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, while this thesis provides a constructive step forward in finding specific partite structures, the broader landscape of algorithmic extremal hypergraph theory, especially concerning tighter bounds and more general forbidden subgraphs, remains rich with open questions.
