\section{Our Algorithm}\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section we present a polynomial-time algorithm to find a balanced partite $k$-graph in a given $k$-graph $G$
with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with part size in the same order of magnitude as stated in
Theorem~\ref{thm:erdos64}.

\begin{remark}
    If we let $q$ be the size of each part in the partite $k$-graph we are looking for, we need
    \[
        m \geq ex(n, K(t, \overset{k}{\cdots}, t)) = O\left(n^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}\right)
    \]
    Defining $d = \frac{m}{n^k}$, and taking logarithms, this is true iff
    \[
        \log d \geq - \frac{\log n}{t^{k-1}} + O(1)
    \]
    which implies
    \[
        t = O\left(\left(\frac{\log n}{\log (1/d)}\right)^{\frac{1}{k-1}}\right)
    \]
\end{remark}

This algorithmic problem has already been solved for $k = 2$ Mubayi and TurÃ¡n~\cite{MUBAYI2010174}.
The algorithm in that case follows very closely the structure of the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:kst}.
We outline the algorithm for $k = 2$ here for context and clarity.
The variable names have been altered to match the notation used in this thesis.
