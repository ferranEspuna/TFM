% Sample article for the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics.
%
% EJC papers *must* begin with the following two lines.
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[amsmath]{e-jc}

% Omit the option "[amsmath]" if you don't want to use the amsmath package.

% GEOMETRY
% Please remove all commands that change parameters such as
%    margins or page sizes. The style file sets them.
% Don't use the fullpage package.

% PACKAGES
% Packages amssymb, amsthm and hyperref are already loaded.
% We recommend the graphicx package for images:
\usepackage{graphicx}
% Forbidden:  fullpage, authblk, babel
\usepackage{algorithm,algpseudocode}

% THEOREM ENVIRONMENTS
% Theorem-like environments that are declared in the style file are:
%   theorem, lemma, corollary, proposition, fact, observation, claim, note
%   definition, example, conjecture, open, problem, question, remark

% CLEVEREF PACKAGE
% The cleveref package is sensitive to the order that packages are loaded,
% and is incompatible with some. If you use \usepackage{cleveref} yourself,
% it will probably not work properly (lemmas will be shown as theorems, etc.).
% The best way is to add it as an option to package e-jc, for example:
%    \usepackage[amsmath,cleveref]{e-jc}
% To pass options to the cleveref package you can do it like this:
%    \def\cleverefoptions{capitalize,noabbrev}
%    \usepackage[amsmath,cleveref]{e-jc}
% Leave out amsmath if you aren't using it, but if you are using
% both amsmath and cleveref you have to do it this way.

% CHARACTER CODES
% Please do not use non-ascii characters in this file, but instead use the LaTex
% macros for characters with diacritical marks, such as G\"{o}del, R\'{e}nyi,
% Erd\H{o}s.  Don't use the package "babel".  Note that this is the opposite
% of the rule for the article metadata that you enter on the web page; sorry
% for the confusion!

% DATES
% Give the submission and acceptance dates in the format shown.
% The editors will insert the publication date in the third argument.
\dateline{Jan 1, 2024}{TBD}{TBD}

% SUBJECT CODES
% Give one or more subject codes separated by commas.
% Codes are available from http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html

% between them is that CC BY-ND only allows distribution unchanged and in

% TITLE
% If needed, include a line break (\\) at an appropriate place in the title.
% Footnotes on titles are not allowed.
\title{Finding Partite Hypergraphs Efficiently}

% AUTHORS
% Input authors, affiliations and addresses as follows.

% The following style is used if the authors don't all have the
% same affiliations.

\author{Ferran Espu√±a\authornote{1}
}

\authortext{1}{ \email{ferranespuna@gmail.com}.}

% Use one \authortext for each affiliation, numbered 1,2,...  and for each
% author indicate which \authortexts apply.  The email address for each
% author goes in the first \authortext for that author.

% If all the authors have the same affiliations, don't use \authornote
% at all. Put the affiliations and email addresses into a single
% \authortext with empty first argument, like this:
%   \authortext{}{Affilation (\email{email1}, \email{email2}).}

% Note that other information such as grants go in the Acknowledgement
% section at the end of the paper, not here.  Don't use \thanks.

% E-JC does not customarily mark one author as "corresponding author"
% and we discourage this practice. However, if this is important for you,
% you may include this information in the \authortext section alongside
% the affiliation for that author.
