\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
In this section we introduce some basic definitions and results that are used throughout this thesis.
We start by defining $k$-graphs, which generalize the usual notion of a graph.

\begin{definition}

    For an integer $k \geq 2$ a finite \emph{$k$-graph}
    is a tuple $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set
    and $E \subset \binom{V}{k}$.
    We call the elements of $V(G) = V$ its \emph{vertices}
    and those of $E(G) = E$ its \emph{edges}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If we let $k=2$ we recover the usual definition of an undirected graph with no loops.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph and $v \in V$.
    The \emph{degree} $d_G(v)$ of $v$ in $G$
    is the number of edges containing $v$, that is
    \[
        d_G(v) = |\{e \in E \mid v \in e\}|.
    \]
\end{definition}

Next, we introduce $k$-graph homomorphisms, embeddings and isomorphisms, which allow us
to relate $k$-graphs (with the same value of $k$) to each other:

\begin{definition}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ and $H = (W, F)$ be $k$-graphs.
    A \emph{homomorphism} from $G$ to $H$ is a map $f: V \to W$
    such that for every edge $e \in E$ the set $f(e) = \{f(v) \mid v \in e\}$
    is an edge in $H$ (that is, $f(e) \in F$). If such a homomorphism exists
    and is injective, we say that $f$ is an embedding of $G$ on $H$
    and that $H$ contains $G$ as a subgraph.
    If, furthermore, $f^{-1}: \text{Im}(f) \to V$ is a homomorphism, we say that $f$
    is an \emph{induced} embedding and that $H$ contains $G$ as an \emph{induced}
    subgraph.
    We write $G \subset H$.
    If, in addition, $f$ is a bijection, we say that $f$ is an \emph{isomorphism}
    and that $G$ is \emph{isomorphic} to $H$.
    We write $G \cong H$.
\end{definition}

It is elementary to check that
(induced) inclusion is an order relation and that
isomorphism is an equivalence relation.
Furthermore, isomorphism preserves (induced) inclusion.
Therefore, we can talk about the (induced) subgraph
condition up to isomorphism, both in the \emph{host} $k$-graph
($H$) and in the \emph{guest} $k$-graph ($G$).

Now we can state the \emph{forbidden subgraph problem} for $k$-graphs.
Informally, given a $k$-graph $G$, and an integer $n \geq |V(G)|$,
we want to find the smallest $M_0$ such that all $k$-graphs with $n$ vertices and $m > M_0$ edges
contain $G$ as a subgraph.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:extremal}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph with nonempty edge set and $n \geq |V|$ be an integer.
    Then there exists an integer $M_0 = ex(n, G) \in \left[ 0, \binom{n}{k}\right)$ such that
    the condition
    \[
        \text{``All $k$-graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges contain $G$ as a subgraph''}
    \]
    is true for all $\binom{n}{k} \geq m > M_0$ and false for all $0 \leq m \leq M_0$.

    \begin{proof}
        Note that, if $M_0$ exists, clearly it is unique.
        Also, the condition is clearly false for $m = 0$ and
        true for $m = \binom{n}{k}$
        (the only graph $H$ with vertex set $W$, $|W|=n$ and $\binom{|V|}{k}$ edges
        is the one having all $k$-sets of vertices so any injective map $f: V \to W$
        is an embedding of $G$ in $H$).
        We only need to show that if the condition is true for $m$ then it is true for
        all $m' \geq m$.
        Suppose it is true for $m$ and let $m' \geq m$.
        Let $H = (W, F)$ be a $k$-graph with $n$ vertices and $m'$ edges.
        We can just take $F' \subset F$ with $|F'| = m$.
        By hypothesis, the graph $H' = (W, F')$ contains $G$ as a subgraph,
        and the identity map in $W$ is an embedding of $H'$ in $H$:
        \[
            G \subset H' \subset H \implies G \subset H. \qedhere
        \]
    \end{proof}

\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    The integer $ex(n, G)$ defined in Proposition~\ref{prop:extremal}
    is called the \emph{extremal number} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The extremal number is clearly invariant under isomorphism of $G$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    for an integer $p \geq k$, a $k$-graph $G = (V, E)$ is \emph{$p$-partite}
    if there exists a partition $V = V_1 \cup \dots \cup V_p$
    such that every edge $e \in E$ intersects every part $V_i$ in at most one vertex.
    We may write $G = (V_1, \dots, V_p; E)$ and say that
    $G$ is a partite $k$-graph on $V_1, \dots, V_p$.
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}\label{rem:ordered}
    If $p=k$, every edge intersects every part in exactly one vertex,
    so we can identify the edges with a subset of $ V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$.
    If it is clear from context, we may slightly abuse notation when talking about ordered and
    unordered sets of vertices, as in the definition below.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    A $k$-partite $k$-graph $G = (V_1, \dots, V_k; E)$ is \emph{complete}
    if $E = V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$.
    That is, if all $(v_1, \dots, v_k) \in V_1 \times \dots \times V_k$
    satisfy $\{v_1, \dots, v_k\} \in E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $V_1, \dots, V_k, W_1, \dots, W_k$ are disjoint sets
    and $|V_i| = |W_i| = a_i$ for all $i$,
    \[
        K(V_1, \dots, V_k) \cong K(W_1, \dots, W_k),
    \]
    where the isomorphism is given by any bijection
    \[
        f: V_1 \times \dots \times V_k \to W_1 \times \dots \times W_k
    \]
    such that $f(V_i) = W_i$ for all $i$.
    This allows us to talk, up to isomorphism, about \emph{the} complete $k$-partite $k$-graph
    with part sizes $a_1, \dots, a_k$, which we denote by
    \[
        K(a_1, \dots, a_k).
    \]

\end{remark}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{figures/222}
    \caption{The complete 3-partite 3-graph $K(2, 2, 2)$, with parts $V_1, V_2, V_3$.
    Each vertex is represented as a black dot while
    each edge is represented as one of the colored dots, and connected by a line to the vertices it contains.}
    \label{fig:222}
\end{figure}

A different but equivalent way to view completeness is to talk about \emph{common neighbors}:
\begin{definition}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a 2-graph.
    The \emph{common neighborhood} of a set $S \subset V$ is
    \[
        N_G(S) = \{y \in V \mid \forall x \in S: \{x, y\} \in E\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

That is, the common neighborhood of a set $S \subset U$ is the maximal set $T \subset W$ such that
$S \times T \subset E$.
Then, a $2$-partite 2-graph $G = (U, W; E)$ is complete if and only if $N_G(U) = W$.
This might seem trivial when dealing with $2$-graphs, but it can be generalized to $k$-graphs
in the following way.

\begin{definition}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $k$-graph.
    Let $S \subset V$ be a set of vertices.
    The \emph{joint link} of $S$ is the $(k-1)$-graph $G_S = (V \setminus S, E')$, where
    \[
        E' = \left\{Y \in \binom{V}{k-1}\middle\vert \, \forall x \in S : \{x\} \cup Y \in E \right\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

Then, we can define completeness of $k$-partite $k$-graphs recursively: If $G = (V_1, \dots, V_k; E)$
is a $k$-partite $k$-graph with $k \geq 3$,
$G$ is complete if and only if the graph $G_{V_k}$ (which is a $(k-1)$-graph, partite on the sets
$V_1, \dots, V_{k-1}$) is complete.



\begin{remark}
    All $k$-partite $k$-graphs with part sizes $b_1 \leq a_1, \dots, b_k \leq a_k$
    are contained in $K(a_1, \dots, a_k)$ as subgraphs.
    This lets us follow the same argument as in Proposition~\ref{prop:extremal}
    to define the following.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:zarankiewicz}
    Let $0 < t_1 \leq v_1, \dots, 0 < t_k \leq v_k$ be integers.
    Then the \emph{generalized Zarankiewicz number} $z(v_1, \dots, v_k; t_1, \dots, t_k)$
    is the largest integer $0 \leq z < \prod_i{ v_i}$ for which there exists a $k$-partite $k$-graph
    $H$ with part sizes $ |V_1| = v_1, \dots, |V_k| = v_k$ and $z$ edges
    such that no embedding $f$ of $K(T_1, \dots, T_k)$ with $|T_i| = t_i$ in it exists
    satisfying $f(T_i) \subset V_i$ for all $i$.
\end{definition}

From now on, every time we talk about embeddings from one $k$-partite $k$-graph
onto another we assume the condition $f(T_i) \subset V_i$.

\begin{remark}\label{rem:zar_vs_turan}
    Finding this number can help us upper bound the extremal number of $K(t_1, \dots, t_k)$ asymptotically:
    Assume that G is a $K(t_1, \dots, t_k)$-free $n$-vertex $k$-graph with $m$ edges.
    pick $v_1, \dots, v_k$ such that $\sum_{i} v_i = n $ and $v_i \sim n/k $
    (For example $\lfloor n/k \rfloor \leq v_i \leq \lceil n/k \rceil$)
    Let $V_1, \dots, V_k$ be a random partition of $V(G)$ with $|V_i| = v_i$.
    for an edge $e \in E(G)$, the probability that $e$ is an edge in $K(V_1, \dots, V_k)$ is
    greater than
    \[k! \prod_i v_i / n \sim k! (1/k)^k\]
    which is independent of $n$.
    Therefore, the expected number of edges satisfying this condition is a positive fraction of $m$.
    Applying the first moment method, we can conclude that
    \[ex(n, K(t_1, \overset{k}{\dots}, t_k)) = O_n(z(\lceil n / k \rceil , \overset{k}{\dots}, \lceil n / k \rceil; t_1, \dots, t_k)).\]

\end{remark}


The problem on finding the Zarankiewicz number was first posed by K. Zarankiewicz in 1951 for the
case of bipartite 2-graphs (that is, finding $z(u, w; s, t)$),
in terms of finding all-1 minors in a $0-1$ matrix.
An upper bound for it in the case $m=n, s=t$ was found by Kővari, Sós and Turán in~\cite{Kovari1954} in 1954.
This was generalized to arbitrary complete
bipartite 2-graphs by C. Hyltén-Cavallius in~\cite{Hylten1958}
in 1958.
The result is stated and proved here for completeness:

% TODO: replace \leq with < ??
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:kst}
    Let $0 < s \leq u$ and $0 < t \leq w$ be integers.
    Then 
    \[z(u, w; s, t) \leq (s - 1)^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)u^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)u\]
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that we have a bipartite graph $G = (U, W; E)$
        with $|U| = u$, $|W| = w$ and $|E| = z$ exceeding the bound stated above.
        Let us consider the set
        \[
            P = \left\{ (x, Y) \in U \times \binom{W}{t}
            \middle\vert\, x \in N_G(Y) \right\}.
        \]
        Counting on the first coordinate, we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_p_lower}
            |P|
            = \nsum_{x \in U} \binom{d_G(x)}{t}
            = \nsum_{x \in U} \varphi(d_G(x))
            \geq u  \nsum_{x \in U} \varphi(z/u)
            = u \binom{z / u}{t},
        \end{equation}
        where we define
        \[
            \varphi(x) =
            \begin{cases}
                \binom{x}{t}, & \text{if } x \geq t - 1. \\
                0, & \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \]
        The function $\varphi$ is convex, so we get the inequality in~\eqref{eq:kst_p_lower}
        as a consequence of Jensen's inequality.
        The other equalities come from the fact that $\varphi(d)$ agrees
        with $\binom{d}{t}$ for all integers $d \geq 0$;
        and that by our bound on $z$, $z \geq (t-1)u \implies z/u \geq t - 1$.

        If we had $s$ different elements of $P$ with the same second coordinate $T$,
        they would all necessarily have different first coordinates
        (say $S = \{x_1, \dots, x_s\}$).
        But now, by definition of $P$, for all $a \in S, b \in T$, we have $\{a, b\} \in E$.
        This would mean that the inclusion map from $ S \cup T$ to $U \cup W$ is an embedding of
        $K(s, t)$ in $G$, as described in Definition~\ref{def:zarankiewicz}.
        Supposing that this is not the case, by the averaging we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_p_upper}
            |P| \leq (s - 1) \binom{w}{t}.
        \end{equation}
        Putting inequalities~\eqref{eq:kst_p_lower} and~\eqref{eq:kst_p_upper}
        together, we get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_chained}
            u \binom{z / u}{t} \leq (s - 1) \binom{w}{t}.
        \end{equation}
        Now, because we can see $E$ as a subset of $U \times W$,
        we get $z \leq uw \implies z/u \leq w$.
        In particular, we have
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:kst_binom}
            \frac{(z/u - (t - 1))^t}{\binom{z/u}{t}} \leq \frac{(w - (t - 1))^t}{\binom{w}{t}},
        \end{equation}
        which is true for each factor when expanding the denominators.
        Multiplying inequalities~\eqref{eq:kst_chained} and~\eqref{eq:kst_binom} yields
        \[
            u \, (z/u - (t - 1))^t \leq (s - 1)(w - (t - 1))^t.
        \]
        Algebraic manipulation then gives
        \[
            z \leq (s - 1)^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)u^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)u,
        \]
        In contradiction with our assumption. \qedhere


    \end{proof}

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    Following Remark~\ref{rem:zar_vs_turan}, we can use this bound to get an upper bound on the extremal number of $K(s, t)$:
    \[
        ex(n, K(s, t)) =
        O_n\left((s - 1)^{1 / t}\left(\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil - t + 1\right)n^{1 - 1 / t} + (t - 1)\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil\right) =
        O_n\left(n^{2 - 1 / t}\right).
    \]
    Note that if $s < t$, we get the better bound $O_n\left(n^{2 - 1 / s}\right)$ by interchanging the roles of $s$ and $t$.
\end{remark}

In 1964, Erdős~\cite{Erods1964} generalized this result to arbitrary complete partite $k$-graphs in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:erdos64}
    For $k \geq 2$ and $2 \leq t \leq \frac{n}{k}$,
    $ex(n, K(t, \overset{k}{\dots}, t)) = O_n\left(n^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}\right)$.
    \begin{proof}
        By Remark~\ref{rem:zar_vs_turan}, it suffices to show that
        \[
            z = z(w, \overset{k}{\dots}, w; t, \overset{k}{\dots}, t) = O_w\left(w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}\right).
        \]
        We prove this by induction on $k$.
        For $k=2$, this is obtained by setting $u = w$ and $s = t$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:kst}.
        For $k > 2$, suppose by way of contradiction that the theorem is false.
        For all ${w_0 \in \N}$, ${K \in \mathbb{R}^+}$, there exists a $k$-partite $k$-graph $G = (W_1, \dots, W_k; E)$ with part sizes
        $|W_i| = w \geq w_0$ and ${|E| \geq K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}}}$ such that no embedding of $K(t, \overset{k}{\dots}, t)$ in it exists.
        Consider, for each set $T \in \binom{W_k}{t}$, the associated joint link $G_T$.
        By our assumption, $G_T$ does not contain $K(t, \overset{k-1}{\dots}, t)$ as a subgraph.
        If we let
        \[
            z' = z(w, \overset{k-1}{\dots}, w; t, \overset{k-1}{\dots}, t),
        \]
        this means that $G_T$ has at most $z'$ edges.

        Now, consider the bipartite graph $G' = (U, W; E')$, where
        \begin{align*}
            U &= W_1 \times \dots \times W_{k-1}, \\
            W &= W_k, \\
            E' &= \{(X, y) \in V \times W \mid X \cup \{y\} \in E\}.
        \end{align*}
        Clearly, $G'$ has the same number of edges as $G$.
        Furthermore, $G'$ does not contain $K(z' + 1, t)$ as a subgraph.
        Finally, we invoke Theorem~\ref{thm:kst} with
        ${u = |U| = w^{k-1}}$ and
        ${s = z' + 1}$ to get
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64_induction}
            K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} \leq
            |E| = |E'| \leq
            (z')^{1 / t}(w - t + 1)w^{(k-1)(1 - 1 / t)} + (t - 1)w^{k-1}.
        \end{equation}
        By the inductive hypothesis, for $w_0$ and $K'$ large enough, we can bound
        \[
            z' \leq K' w^{(k - 1) - \frac{1}{t^{k-2}}}.
        \]
        Substituting this into inequality~\eqref{eq:erdos64_induction} and approximating yields
        \[
            K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} \leq (K')^{1 / t} w^{k-\frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} + (t - 1)w^{k-1}.
        \]
        Combining like terms and picking $K > 2 (K')^{1 / t}$ gives
        \[
            \frac{1}{2}K w^{k - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} < (t - 1)w^{k-1},
        \]
        which we can rewrite as
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:erdos64_contradiction}
            \frac{1}{2}Kw^{1 - \frac{1}{t^{k-1}}} < (t - 1).
        \end{equation}
        This is a contradiction, because the right side of inequality~\eqref{eq:erdos64_contradiction}
        is constant in $w$, while the left side grows to infinity as $w$ increases.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

This approach can be generalized to give a lower bound on the number of
copies of $K(t_1, \dots, t_k)$ in a $k$-partite $k$-graph $G$
with different part sizes~\cite{carvajal2024canonical},
therefore upper bounding all generalized Zarankiewicz numbers.
